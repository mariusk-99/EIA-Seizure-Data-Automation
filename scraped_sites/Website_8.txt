	PRETORIA – The Hawks' Priority Crime Specialised Investigation (PCSI) at Head Office working in collaboration with Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) of the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) secured a preservation order of a vehicle valued at eighty thousand rand (R80 000).

	The preservation order was awarded by the Gauteng Local Division of the High Court in Johannesburg on 15 May 2023.  This followed the arrest of a 59-year-old Chinese woman by Hawks' Serious Organised Crime Investigation together with Ekurhuleni Metro Police for possession of rhino horns. The team acted on information received about a foreign national driving a blue Honda CRV in Bedfordview, Johannesburg.

	The team spotted the vehicle fitting the description, it was stopped and searched on 19 April 2019. Two rhino horns were recovered and the vehicle used to transport the rhino horns were seized for further investigation. The suspect was released on R100 000 bail by the Germiston Regional Court on 10 June 2019. She never returned to court, subsequently her bail money was forfeited to the State and a warrant for her arrest was issued.
