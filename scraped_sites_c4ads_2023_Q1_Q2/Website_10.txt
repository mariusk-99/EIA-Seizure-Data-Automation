Police later served a warrant at Castro-Alcaraz‚Äôs home on Carson Road, near 27th Avenue and Baseline Road. In addition to the tiger, an American alligator and a dozen snapping turtles were also seized.‚ÄúYou could hear the tiger in the background moaning. You can hear that something wasn‚Äôt normal,‚Äù said Sgt. Brian Bower with Phoenix PD. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs a bigger ring for exotic animals. This is definitely just the tip of the iceberg as a potential, but our detectives will look into it and will want to identify if there‚Äôs a larger scheme behind this,‚Äù said Bower.TRENDING: Developers announce $850 million plan to revitalize Metrocenter Mall spaceCastro-Alcaraz was arrested and booked into the Maricopa County jail on a number of felony wildlife offenses. According to court paperwork, he told officers he purchased the tiger cub last week for $8,000 from another Arizona man. Castro-Alcaraz reportedly said the man wasn‚Äôt taking care of the animal and that he bought it because he felt bad for the tiger. The animals have since been turned over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife. According to the Arizona code for Game and Fish, there‚Äôs a long list of animals that are illegal to own unless you have the proper licenses or permits. Some obvious ones are big cats, alligators and crocodiles, bears, and large primates. But some odd and obscure illegal pets on the list are weasels, European hedgehogs, new world porcupines, spider monkeys, woodchucks, sloths, armadillos, Gila monsters, and piranhas, to name a few.This little guy is not the only one earning his stripes.üêØ 25yo Carlos¬† Alcaraz was arrested on 1/23 & booked on possession of live wildlife & game and fish violations after advertising the cub on social media. #PHXPD600Patrol negotiated the sale of the cub and served a warrant. pic.twitter.com/e0LDWIMdvr‚Äî Phoenix Police (@PhoenixPolice) January 24, 2023
