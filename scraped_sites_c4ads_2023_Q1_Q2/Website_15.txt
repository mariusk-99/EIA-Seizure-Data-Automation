Last week, Mexican officials made a surprising discovery at a port of entry in northern Sonora.While searching a semi truck at a customs facility near Sonoyta, Sonora — where most Arizonans cross the border en route to Rocky Point — officials, including members of the National Guard, found a Bengal tiger. The subspecies is considered endangered.The driver of the truck was arrested, and the tiger was reportedly taken to the Sonoran Ecological Center in Hermosillo.A report from the Center for Biological Diversity released late last year found that wildlife trafficking is a major issue in Mexico, with sales occurring brazenly on social media and authorities overwhelmed by the scale of criminal activity.
