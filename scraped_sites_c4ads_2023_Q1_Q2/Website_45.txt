 The three detained suspects.
						



Three suspects have been detained after a Brackendowns SAPS officer reported that a pangolin was being sold at a nearby house in the Brackenhurst neighbourhood.
The Pangolin (an endangered species) was discovered in the alleged offenders’ possession after their car was stopped and searched.


All three suspects were taken into custody and brought to the Brackendowns SAPS, where they were turned over to a section that specialises in these specific cases.
The pangolin was recovered and seized.










The Alberton Record will provide more information regarding this matter once available.
