According to the provincial spokesperson, Tlangelani Rikhotso, four more suspects, aged between 43 and 59, have been arrested.It is alleged that the suspects were heading to Mahikeng to meet a buyer for the pangolin that they were selling for R60 000, when they were stopped by members of the Hawks’ Serious Organised Crime Investigation Unit and members of SAPS' Tactical Response Team, along the Vryburg Road.“In the boot of the vehicle, the team found a bag containing a pangolin. The vehicle was seized for further investigation and the pangolin was handed over to members of Nature Conservation,” Rikhotso added. The four suspects will appear before the Mmabatho Magistrate’s Court on Monday 5 June 2023 for contravention of the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act 10 of 2004.ALSO READ: Six in court after pangolin found in car's bootSix people appeared in the Zeerust Magistrate's Court on Tuesday 13 December 2022 for the illegal possession of a pangolin.
