A room-like cage has helped authorities catch the prowling cats12 MYSURU/ MANDYA: In a first in Karnataka, two leopards - a five-year-old mother and its one-year-old cub - walked straight into a specially designed cage in T Narasipura taluk’s Musuvina Koppalu village early on Friday. The big cats are relocated to a rescue centre in Mysuru.The village is close to the area where four people, which included the suspected death of an 11-year-old boy in a leopard attack, were killed by the big cats in the last three months.This is the fourth incident of big cats being trapped in the region.A room-like cage borrowed from foresters in Tumakuru has helped authorities catch the prowling cats and this is reckoned to be the first time two leopards were caught together in Karnataka.Residents of Musuvina Koppalu were relieved after the leopards that were being sighted frequently since a few weeks were trapped. Cages was set at the village 13 days back on January 28.DCF KN Basavaraj said after villagers complained of sightings of a mother and cub, the cage was placed with live bait, which helped foresters to nab the prowling big cats. The leopards were caught in the same conflict region where human deaths were reported in the radius of 6 kilometres in T Narasipura. After the successful trapping of the first leopard in ML Hundi on the hillock of Ukkalagere, Mysuru foresters have developed a similar cage to trap leopards if any.Two cages – one brought from Tumakuru was kept in Musuvina Koppalu and another made by the Mysuru foresters, was placed at Horalahalli, where a boy was mauled to death. Foresters are designing similar cages which is like a room to trap leopards in conflict zones. 2 leopard cubs seized Forest officials have seized two leopard cubs from a farmer from Kulagere village of Maddur taluk. When farmer Shivamurthy went to his farm, he saw eight leopard cubs. But the leopardess escaped with her 6 cubs while two were left behind.The farmer rescued the cubs, brought them to his home and informed forest officials. The officials rushed to the spot and seized the leopard cubs, RFO Gaviyappa said.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories   Previous10 saris of Kajol which are perfect for Saraswati Pujaindia10 times Ambani ladies stunned in Sabyasachi creationsindia10 five-minute habits that will lead to a happy lifeindiaUnique baby names inspired by Mahadevindia13 Basant Panchami recipes from different parts of IndiaFood10 psychological tricks that always work in a relationshipindiaJennifer Winget: Fitness tips to borrow from the 'Beyhadh' actorindia11 Marwari dishes one needs to tryFoodChildhood Trauma: 10 things that push children towards itindia8 health disadvantages of being a vegetarianindia Next123Hot PicksDriverless Metro TrainMSP FarmersTNSDC WhatsApp ChatbotSC Electoral Bonds SchemeDelhi's Najafgarh TrafficHaldwani ViolenceBharat Bandh on Feb 16Loot in India Reserve BattalionBharat Jodo Nyay Yatra Live UpdateDattajirao Gaekwad Passes AwayTOP TRENDSFarmers ProtestElectoral Bonds SchemeCongress Lok Sabha Candidates ListBJP Lok Sabha Candidates ListPM Modi UAE VisitBundelkhand BlastTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteHeart blockage of 50-year-old cured with ayurvedic therapyFarmers Protest Live Updates: Panel of 3 union ministers to hold talks with farmer leaders in ChandigarhTNSDC’s Ilaya WhatsApp chatbot achieves more than 800 job placements in 20 daysWhy Supreme Court struck down electoral bonds schemeShark attacks man in Maharashtra river;
