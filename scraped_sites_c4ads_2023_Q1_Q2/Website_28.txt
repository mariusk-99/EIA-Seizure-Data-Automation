He added that during interrogation, Khan disclosed that two of his associates managed to flee just before he was caught. “He disclosed that the recovered skin was given to him by his associate Rahul Rawat (22) and Deepak Kumar (28). At Khan’s instance, Kumar – a resident of Prem Nagar in Gurugram – was arrested from Kullu in Himachal Pradesh, while Rawat was nabbed near his residence in Vasant Kunj. During the course of the investigation, one more suspect, identified as 22-year-old Mohit (goes by single name), was also arrested from Vasant Kunj. Mohit disclosed that the recovered tiger skin was provided to them by one Shivam Sisodia (24) of Mahipalpur in Delhi and some more skins could also be recovered from him. The team conducted a raid in Mahipalpur, and nabbed Sisodia. At his instance, one more tiger skin recovered from the jungle area near Qutub Vihar,” he said.  Yadav said that during interrogation, it emerged that Sisodia was the main source of the tiger skins. “He had four tiger skins. He approached Mohit and asked him for a buyer and handed over one tiger skin as a sample. Kumar was arranging customers for the illegal deal. We have also recovered four mobile phones from their possession, which were used in the commission of crime. A case under sections 9, 39, 49, 49(1)B and 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972 and sections 120B and 34 of the Indian Penal Code was lodged at the Crime Branch police station,” the special CP said, adding that further investigation is going on to recover more tiger skins and to locate the source of smuggling.
