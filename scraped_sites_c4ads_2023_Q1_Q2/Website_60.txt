 The two accused identified as Bedabyasa Dharua (41) and Nabadeep Dharua (29), both are residents of Sonepur district.
The STF rescued two live pangolins weighing 7 kg and 3 kg, and seized other incriminating materials from their possession, the official said.
Both the arrested persons have been handed over to Sonepur forest officials.
 The live pangolins were also handed over to DFO Sonepur for safe custody, he said.
The Indian pangolin (Maniscrassicaudata), also called thick-tailed pangolin, scaly anteater and ‘bajrakapta’ (in Odia)’ is a solitary, shy, slow-moving, nocturnal mammal.
It is a Schedule I protected animal under Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.
Schedule I provides absolute protection — offences under these are prescribed for the highest penalties.
