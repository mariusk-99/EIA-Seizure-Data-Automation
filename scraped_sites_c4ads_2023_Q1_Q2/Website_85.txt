Even a six-month-old tiger cub looks as big as a leopard. The base fur on the chest and belly is white and is prominent in skins too,” they said.“As per the forest release the skin measures 82cmX79cm. The length of the tail of a tiger is approximately one-third of the length of the whole skin, and not a few centimeters. This instant skin is suspected to be a fake one unless there is some mutation in tigers,” they said.Talking to TOI, deputy conservator of forests (DyCF) Bharat Singh Hada said, “Initially I too felt that skin looks different. However, I asked officials to cross-check. They washed it with turpentine but the color of the skin did not wear out. It seems to be a real one. Yet, we will do a forensic check.”Hada said the main accused told officials that the tiger skin was found in a cupboard of a tenant who had locked the room and left the house without paying any rent. “Investigations are still going on and we plan to take forest custody of the accused to get into the depth of the case,” said Hada.For the past few days, forest teams from Nagpur and Bhandara were keeping a watch after getting a tip-off that a tiger skin was being smuggled from Chandrapur. On Wednesday the teams laid a trap and nailed the culprits driving a scooter on the Nilaj-Adyal road in the Paoni forest range. “The accused seem to be habitual wildlife offenders and are suspected to be involved in performing black magic. There were some videos in the mobile phones which showed a porcupine quail and an owl leg and wildlife incriminating material,” said officials.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories   Previous10 five-minute habits that will lead to a happy lifeindiaUnique baby names inspired by Mahadevindia10 saris of Kajol which are perfect for Saraswati Pujaindia11 Marwari dishes one needs to tryFood10 psychological tricks that always work in a relationshipindiaJennifer Winget: Fitness tips to borrow from the 'Beyhadh' actorindia10 times Ambani ladies stunned in Sabyasachi creationsindia8 challenges only the eldest daughter faces in a familyindia13 Basant Panchami recipes from different parts of IndiaFoodChildhood Trauma: 10 things that push children towards itindia Next123Hot PicksNCP vs NCPDriverless Metro TrainMSP FarmersTNSDC WhatsApp ChatbotSC Electoral Bonds SchemeDelhi's Najafgarh TrafficHaldwani ViolenceBharat Bandh on Feb 16Loot in India Reserve BattalionBharat Jodo Nyay Yatra Live UpdateTOP TRENDSFarmers ProtestElectoral Bonds SchemeMamata BanerjeeBJP Lok Sabha Candidates ListFarooq AbdullahPM Modi UAE VisitTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteNCP vs NCP Disqualification Live Updates: Maharashtra assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar starts reading out his ruling on disqualification petitions filed by rival NCP factionsGame up for KCR, I will be CM for next 10 years: Telangana CM A Revanth ReddyHeart blockage of 50-year-old cured with ayurvedic therapyFarmers Protest Live Updates: Panel of 3 union ministers to hold talks with farmer leaders in ChandigarhTNSDC’s Ilaya WhatsApp chatbot achieves more than 800 job placements in 20 daysWhy Supreme Court struck down electoral bonds schemeShark attacks man in Maharashtra river;
