Baripada: Forest department officials seized 7 kg of pangolin scales and arrested two persons during a special operation in Odisha’s Mayurbhanj district on Thursday.
The seizure was made during a raid at Badakhama under Kaptipada forest range in the district, sources said. The arrested persons have been identified as Mangal Singh and Gansa Ho.
Acting on a tip-off, a team of forest officials conducted raids at the houses of Mangal Singh and Gansa Ho and seized 7 kg of pangolin scales. Both were arrested as they failed to produce any legal evidence regarding the seized products.
This apart, the forest team also seized four country-made pistols, meat of animals, a trap, and a tail of an animal.
Forest officials are now interrogating the arrested persons to know more about the illegal act and if any other person and persons are involved.
