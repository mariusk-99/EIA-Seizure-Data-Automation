There are about 100 tigers inside the STR. The state Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and STR officials arrested Rathna, Mangal, Krishna and Ramchandar - all from Panchkula in Haryana - and two women.All belong to the same hunter tribe. Officials recovered one tiger skin, one leopard skin, bones, nails, teeth and other trophies from them. This is not their first arrest though. In 2012, all these men and women had been convicted and jailed for three years in connection with a poaching case at Kollegal in Karnataka. During interrogation, they told the officials that in order not to leave behind any evidence of poaching, they had cooked and eaten the tiger.An official from Traffic India, told TOI that the gang had a history of assisting maharajas and Britishers in the pre-Independence era in in hunting tigers. "Their modus operandi is to enter the forests, look for the tiger using their traditional knowledge, pug marks and scent. They lie in wait for a tiger to get isolated in a territorial fight and then attack it using a jaw trap. They are experts in it and are not scared of the big cat at all," he said."This gang had been roaming in the Western Ghats for over a decade now," R Kanchana, who heads the state Wildlife Crime Control Bureau, said, adding, further investigation using modern technology was on.The deputy director, Satyamangalam division, STR, P Kirubashankar, said the gang had been roaming mostly in the Nilgiris. "We tracked them whenever they set up tents near STR and nearby villages.Based on intelligence we shadow them. They killed these animals in the Nilgiris. We got information that they are in Arasur with some of the wildlife trophies. When they came to sell these items, we arrested them," said Kirubashankar.Whether any racketeers are operating this gang remotely or if there are more such poachers camping in other parts of the state forests are being probed, the officer said.The seized wildlife trophies will be produced before the jurisdictional magistrate, kept in custody during trial and be destroyed after verdict is delivered.Explore Your Financial Landscape with Personalized Credit Insights.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories   Previous10 five-minute habits that will lead to a happy lifeindiaUnique baby names inspired by Mahadevindia10 saris of Kajol which are perfect for Saraswati Pujaindia11 Marwari dishes one needs to tryFood10 psychological tricks that always work in a relationshipindiaJennifer Winget: Fitness tips to borrow from the 'Beyhadh' actorindia10 times Ambani ladies stunned in Sabyasachi creationsindia8 challenges only the eldest daughter faces in a familyindia13 Basant Panchami recipes from different parts of IndiaFoodChildhood Trauma: 10 things that push children towards itindia Next123Hot PicksNCP vs NCPDriverless Metro TrainMSP FarmersTNSDC WhatsApp ChatbotSC Electoral Bonds SchemeDelhi's Najafgarh TrafficHaldwani ViolenceBharat Bandh on Feb 16Loot in India Reserve BattalionBharat Jodo Nyay Yatra Live UpdateTOP TRENDSFarmers ProtestElectoral Bonds SchemeMamata BanerjeeBJP Lok Sabha Candidates ListFarooq AbdullahPM Modi UAE VisitTrending StoriesIn CityEntire WebsiteNCP vs NCP Disqualification Live Updates: Maharashtra assembly speaker Rahul Narwekar starts reading out his ruling on disqualification petitions filed by rival NCP factionsGame up for KCR, I will be CM for next 10 years: Telangana CM A Revanth ReddyHeart blockage of 50-year-old cured with ayurvedic therapyFarmers Protest Live Updates: Panel of 3 union ministers to hold talks with farmer leaders in ChandigarhTNSDC’s Ilaya WhatsApp chatbot achieves more than 800 job placements in 20 daysWhy Supreme Court struck down electoral bonds schemeShark attacks man in Maharashtra river;
