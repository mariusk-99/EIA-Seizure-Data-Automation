A 43-year-old man is set to appear in the Kempton Park Magistrate's Court on Monday on charges linked to the smuggling of lion bones.




Supplied: SAPS














The suspect was arrested at OR Tambo International Airport as he was about to board a flight to Vietnam. The bones of five lions were found in his luggage.  Police spokesperson Bonnie Nxumalo says the suspect’s luggage raised suspicion when it was scanned and because of its enormous weight.   “The suspect was arrested when the Bidvest security guards at the airport discovered suspicious items in his luggage. The Germiston based Hawks’ Economic Protected Resources members were alerted."Nxumalo says the man is facing various charges including illegal dealing in wildlife, possession of lion bones, and contravening the National Environmental Management Biodiversity Act. “We suspect that the lions were from South Africa, but investigations are ongoing to confirm the information." ALSO READ:
