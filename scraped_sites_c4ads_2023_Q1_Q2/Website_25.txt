Privacy NoticeA Cornwall seaside resident was left baffled and rather disgusted after discovering the most unusual item in the cave on the beach below his house - a sawn-off rhino horn. John Roundhill was walking down into the cave that sits under his home at Willy Wilcox Cottage in Polperro, near Looe in south east Cornwall, when he came across a thick chunk of what looked at first like a bit of wood. After picking it up, the personnel head hunter thought it could be a horse hoof. However when he got one of his friends on the case, it was confirmed as a rhino horn that had been sawn off, probably from a live animal in sub-Saharan Africa. John said: "I was showing some visitors the cave at low tide when I discovered a sawn-off rhino horn wedged into a crevice. My friend who used to live in Africa and still has plenty of contact over there contacted rangers who confirmed it was from a rhino. I was astounded, frankly, that it was here and, I admit, a little disgusted that it had been sawn off an live animal." Read next: Polperro in Cornwall crowned the coolest place to live in the UK Willy Wilcox Cave is a well-known tourist attraction in Polperro as it was reputedly used by the famous eponymous smuggler who is said to have lived in the house above and apparently a passage existed from the cave to the house. John said all the information he managed to gather points towards the posterior horn on a rhino's head rather than the tall pointy one at the front. "It's certainly the first time I have ever discovered anything remotely like this on the beach," John said. "It doesn't look like it's been in the water for month and months. There's no barnacles or algae. It's a bit damaged on the top. But it just begs the question how it got there?" Get our top stories delivered to your inbox every day.

 John thought the unusual find could have been thrown overboard from a boat after it was discovered and whoever discarded it decided they did not want to be found with poached wildlife onboard. Or it was in someone's house in Cornwall and perhaps belonged to someone with historic connections to Africa, who, again, did not want any association with the gruesome find. "I took it to the police," John added, "in case they had any ongoing investigations into animal poaching or ivory smuggling - that kind of things. But they didn't. The plan is to give to animal charity so it can be disposed of appropriately." The brown rhino horn measures about 20 centimetres in diameter at the base and about 11cm in height. It is worn at the top and is missing a piece. Rhino horns are similar in structure to horses’ hooves, turtle beaks and cockatoo bills. According to Save the Rhino charity, there has been growing demand for rhino horns, especially from China, where it is in traditional medicine, but increasingly common is its use as a status symbol to display success and wealth.  John added: "This raises the question as to whether it has travelled in the sea from Africa or if there is active smuggling directly to the UK by sea. And perhaps begs the question as to how many other illegal objects there might be washed up on the Cornish coastline."
