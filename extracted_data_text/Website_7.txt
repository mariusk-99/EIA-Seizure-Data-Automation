    Lâm Văn Du and Võ Văn Trạng knew each other. On 17 May, Du went to trap mice and accidentally 
    found a pangolin stuck in the trap, weighing about 4.5 kg. Du called Trang to find someone to 
    sell the pangolin. Trang agreed with a man (unknown identity) to sell the pangolin at a price 
    of 1.8 million VND/kg. Du promised to give Trang 500,000 VND after selling the pangolin. When

    forest animals listed in the Red Book, but they violated the law for profit."
